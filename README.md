# Interactive 3D r/place with Daily Creative Challenges

## Welcome to the 3D Collaborative Building Challenge!

Every 24 hours, a new themed challenge is posted, such as:
- **"Build the Empire State Building"**
- **"Create your favorite meme in 3D"**

The community collaborates to construct the theme from scratch. Once the 24-hour period ends, the creation is preserved, and a new challenge begins!
